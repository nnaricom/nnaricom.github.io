## Gameplay
* Space with FAir / BAir and mixup grabs and projectiles. Don't aggro.
* Don't warp too close to your opponent.
* Don't use Explosive Flame if your opponent is close to you or if it's too predictable.
* Don't use Explosive Flame for pressure if your opponent is close to you in general.
* Edgeguard your opponent if you can, don't just use explosive flame from afar.
* NAir / BAir are your best edgeguarding tools.
* Use attacks out of disadvantage sparingly, don't spam them.
* Fadeback aerials for spacing & whiff baiting.
* If you're offstage you should be mostly recovering to the ledge.
* If they're below a platform you can warp cancel to then ledgecancel BAir can work.
* Focus on whiff punishing, SH FF BAir (and FAir) is good for baiting approaches.
* Remember you can USmash OoS
* Mixup your ledge options (more to add here)
* GO EDGEGUARD WITH NAIR!
* Trap landings with UAir / EF. UAir is better with platforms.
* Mixup DThrow BAir / UAir
* Use warp cancels
* Mixup warp landings
* NAir popup to UTilt/USmash/DSmash
* DTilt can 2 frame into FAir
* Punish spotdodges with FTilt and USmash if kill%
* Mixup fullhops sometimes
* Autoreticle to shut down grounded approaches
* Jab 1 can be a fun poke to make your opponent roll / jump
