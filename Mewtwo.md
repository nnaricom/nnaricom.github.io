# Mewtwo Ultimate 1.2 Analysis

## Strengths 
* Top tier mobility, one of the best aerial + grounded mobility  
* Top tier edgeguarding, shadow ball + aerial can frame trap offstage  
* Shadow ball is better than in Smash 4 since it is slower, can catch dodges/ledge options better
* Jab is much better now
* Disable has been buffed. It is faster, has invincibility frames and way more range
* Combo game is very good
* One of the best recoveries in the whole game
* FAir is still good
* Ftilt can be angled to hit on the ledge and can kill

## Weaknesses
* Terrible disadvantage, big floaty hitbox and the airdodge nerf doesn't help him, no good moves to land with
* Confusion can no longer stall and has less reflect frames and less range
* Dtilt has more endlag now
* NAir has been heavily nerfed and doesn't have many combo options
* Mewtwo needs space and big stages
* Really light so he dies early, not as early as in Smash 4 however
* UThrow is slightly weaker now (will kill 10% later)
* Shadow Ball has terrible priority (even full charge)

### Neutral game
Mewtwo's best tools in neutral are the following in no particular order:
* DTilt
* Shadow Ball
* FAir
* FThrow for damage
* BThrow for getting the opponent offstage
* UTilt and mixups with UAir to catch landings & platform pressure (@ScrubSalehi#3991)

### Advanced Techniques
* Bread and butter B-reverses for landing are good.
* Not exactly AT but parry into disable is very good.
* Shadow Ball can be double jump canceled into any action if jump is being input 3 frames before landing.
* Shadow Ball can be canceled with jump. Good for fakeouts and faking that you're shooting the SB.

### Mewtwo specific ledge options
* DJC Disable
* DJC Shadowball into any action (usually grab)
* DJ FAir / Upair
